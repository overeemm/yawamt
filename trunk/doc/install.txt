Yet Another Web App Monitoring Tool, 2009

>> installing yawamt
The install process is not really polished, but should work.

1. Create the registry keys: 
   execute the config.reg file (after examening the different values)
   
2. Create an empty SQL database (you can use the .exe in the Util folder for this.
   Just call utility.exe --createdb
   
3. Configure the virtual directory for the website
   When using IIS 6: create a wildcard mapping.
   
4. Install the windows service (using the batch files)

5. Check everything and pray that it works :-)
